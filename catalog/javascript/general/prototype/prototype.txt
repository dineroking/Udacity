console.log("gold.a:");
console.log(gold.a);
console.log("gold.z:");
console.log(gold.z);
//copies gold object into the blue object
var blue = $.extend({}, gold);
console.log("blue.a:");
console.log(blue.a);

In the case above, gold object is copied into the blue object but only once when the code is executed. After that any
changes made to either object is not longer copied.

The following links rose object to the gold object so at any time a property is added or changed in the gold object
it is updated in the rose object.

var rose = Object.create(gold);
